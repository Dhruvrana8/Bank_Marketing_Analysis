# Data Science Project - Semester 1

This project involves analyzing and gaining insights from banking data provided by the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository - Bank Marketing Dataset.

Data set -> https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing

## Project Overview

In this project, we will perform an in-depth analysis of the banking dataset to explore various data science techniques and practices. The primary goal is to understand and interpret customer behavior patterns and apply machine learning models for marketing decision-making.

## Objectives

Review and analyze the banking data to derive meaningful insights.
Apply data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering.
Build and evaluate predictive models to help improve marketing strategies.
